Speech Emotion Recognition project using MLP classifier and python

1.1	  PROBLEM
                  Speech emotion recognition is the process of creating a model to predict  emotions from  speech based on the various features extracted from the speech. Regardless of the remarkable enhancement made in understanding natural language & speech, still we are not capable of communicating with the machines naturally.
                 Designing a method for understanding human emotions   (sad, happy, angry, disgusting, etc.,) could be dominant for several human interactions of computer applications. Nevertheless, it could be very challenging to design such methods.
1.2	  EXISTING   SYSTEM   & DRAWBACKS
                 Most of the existing speech emotion recognition system uses CNN and other Classifiers like SVM. 
                 The problem in that are they are hard to implement and also the neural network architecture gets more complex or deeper .

1.3	  PROPOSED SOLUTION
                   We here using MLP classifier for creating the Speech Emotion Recognition System. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network. 
                    An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training.
            
1.4	  PROPOSED SOLUTION’S ADVANTAGE
                     There was one point in time where MLP was the state-of-art neural networks. As the neural network architecture gets more complex or deeper, or evolve, MLP looks increasing simpler and more vanilla. 
                   MLP’s multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.
